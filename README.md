# Timeline Unsubscribe
Chrome extension that allows us to unsubscribe directly from timeline

Facebook require us to use this painfull way when don't want to see something anymore, first we need to click on 3 dots, then wait for asynchronious call to FB server, then try to find text for unsubscribing. Sometimes it's even hidden inside a "more options" sections. That's a lot of work to do actually, which prevents us from filtering what we read and see. I believe that people should have control over the flow, we should be able to leave media directly from the timeline, thats why I made this extension mostly for myself. 

I hope with this chrome extension we can left toxic and annoying media much easier.

It's a simple JavaScript + Jquery script. I don't do any activity tracking or saving data, you can check by yourself in main.js
This is how it looks:
